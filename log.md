# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 20, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Solved a question on HackerRanks, started to play around with CSS again for my website, creating Ghost blog layout. 

**Thoughts:** did a few exercises on Teamtreehouse #15minschallenge (Learn Java track) only to realise I cannot count the doing online courses as part of the challenge, so I had to figure out what I could do more. So, now I'm in the middle of finding some inspirations for Ghost blog layout. I firstly would have to create a static HTML & CSS using HTML5 boilerplate (automatically created in PHP Storm IDE)

**Link to work:** None, yet as I would need to create a repo for the theme.
