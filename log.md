# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 20, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Solved a question on HackerRanks, started to play around with CSS again for my website, creating Ghost blog layout. 

**Thoughts:** did a few exercises on Teamtreehouse #15minschallenge (Learn Java track) only to realise I cannot count doing online courses as part of the challenge, so I had to figure out what I could do more. So, now I'm in the middle of finding some inspirations for Ghost blog layout. I firstly would have to create a static HTML & CSS using HTML5 boilerplate (automatically created in PHP Storm IDE)

**Link to work:** None, yet as I would need to create a repo for the theme. 

### Day 1: February 21, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Created another container to put inside a div, so that the width of the header and the footer container can be 100%. 

**Thoughts** Getting frustrated with not being able to get the footer to stick to the bottom of the browser.

### Day 2: February 22, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've fixed the CSS for the footer to stick to the bottom of the page if content is less than the height of the browser. 

**Thoughts** I created the layout based on 212 assignment, just wanting to have colourful layout, not exactly sure where I'm heading with this colour scheme.

### Day 3: February 24, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I learned about box-sizing again. 

**Thoughts** I need to get my head around `box-sizing: border-box;` concept, as explained here: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/box-sizing-secret-simple-css-layouts

### Day 4: February 25, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Played around with media queries (CSS), and to start with mobile-first approach.

**Thoughts** I'm getting slack at CSS, it can get slightly draining but I need to keep going, even if I don't like it.

### Day 5: February 26, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I practised Java, did a revision to prepare for classes tomorrow, in case I've forgotten a few concepts.

**Thoughts** There's a few exercises that I should be doing. I'm also slack at Tweeting my daily progress, let alone updating my log. I should do this often. 

**Link(s) to work** none
